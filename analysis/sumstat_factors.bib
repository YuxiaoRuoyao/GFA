@article{Chasman2020,
abstract = {Genetic risk for a disease in the population may be represented as a genetic risk score (GRS) constructed as the sum of inherited risk alleles, weighted by allelic effects established in an independent population. While this formulation captures overall genetic risk, it typically does not address risk due to specific biological mechanisms or pathways that may nevertheless be important for interpretation or treatment response. Here, a GRS for disease is resolved into independent or nearly independent components pertaining to biological mechanisms inferred from pleiotropic relationships. The component GRSs' weights are derived from the singular value decomposition (SVD) of the matrix of appropriately scaled genetic effects, i.e., beta coefficients, of the disease variants across a panel of the disease-related phenotypes. The SVD-based formalism also associates combinations of disease-related phenotypes with inferred disease pathways. Applied to incident type 2 diabetes (T2D) in the Women's Genome Health Study (N = 23,294), component GRSs discriminate glycemic control and lipid-based genetic risk, while revealing significant interactions between specific components and BMI or physical activity, the latter not observed with a GRS for overall T2D genetic liability. Applied to coronary artery disease (CAD) in both the WGHS and in JUPITER (N = 8,749), a randomized trial of rosuvastatin for primary prevention of CVD, component GRSs discriminate genetic risk associated with LDL-C from risk associated with reciprocal genetic effects on triglycerides and HDL-C. They also inform the pharmacogenetics of statin treatment by demonstrating that benefit from rosuvastatin is as strongly related to genetic risk from triglycerides and HDL-C as from LDL-C.},

abstract = {Multi-omics studies promise the improved characterization of biological processes across molecular layers. However, methods for the unsupervised integration of the resulting heterogeneous data sets are lacking. We present Multi-Omics Factor Analysis (MOFA), a computational method for discovering the principal sources of variation in multi-omics data sets. MOFA infers a set of (hidden) factors that capture biological and technical sources of variability. It disentangles axes of heterogeneity that are shared across multiple modalities and those specific to individual data modalities. The learnt factors enable a variety of downstream analyses, including identification of sample subgroups, data imputation and the detection of outlier samples. We applied MOFA to a cohort of 200 patient samples of chronic lymphocytic leukaemia, profiled for somatic mutations, RNA expression, DNA methylation and ex vivo drug responses. MOFA identified major dimensions of disease heterogeneity, including immunoglobulin heavy-chain variable region status, trisomy of chromosome 12 and previously underappreciated drivers, such as response to oxidative stress. In a second application, we used MOFA to analyse single-cell multi-omics data, identifying coordinated transcriptional and epigenetic changes along cell differentiation.},

abstract = {Many common variants have been associated with hematological traits, but identification of causal genes and pathways has proven challenging. We performed a genome-wide association analysis in the UK Biobank and INTERVAL studies, testing 29.5 million genetic variants for association with 36 red cell, white cell, and platelet properties in 173,480 European-ancestry participants. This effort yielded hundreds of low frequency (<5%) and rare (<1%) variants with a strong impact on blood cell phenotypes. Our data highlight general properties of the allelic architecture of complex traits, including the proportion of the heritable component of each blood trait explained by the polygenic signal across different genome regulatory domains. Finally, through Mendelian randomization, we provide evidence of shared genetic pathways linking blood cell indices with complex pathologies, including autoimmune diseases, schizophrenia, and coronary heart disease and evidence suggesting previously reported population associations between blood cell indices and cardiovascular disease may be non-causal.},

Estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as a marker of kidney function is commonly used to diagnose CKD. We analyze eGFR data from the Nord-Tr{\o}ndelag Health Study and Michigan Genomics Initiative and perform a GWAS meta-analysis with public summary statistics, more than doubling the sample size of previous meta-analyses. We identify 147 loci (53 novel) associated with eGFR, including genes involved in transcriptional regulation, kidney development, cellular signaling, metabolism, and solute transport. Additionally, sex-stratified analysis identifies one locus with more significant effects in women than men. Using genetic risk scores constructed from these eGFR meta-analysis results, we show that associated variants are generally predictive of CKD with only modest improvements in detection compared with other known clinical risk factors. Collectively, these results yield additional insight into the genetic factors underlying kidney function and progression to CKD.},

@article{Runcie2013,
abstract = {Quantitative genetic studies that model complex, multivariate phenotypes are important for both evolutionary prediction and artificial selection. For example, changes in gene expression can provide insight into developmental and physiological mechanisms that link genotype and phenotype. However, classical analytical techniques are poorly suited to quantitative genetic studies of gene expression where the number of traits assayed per individual can reach many thousand. Here, we derive a Bayesian genetic sparse factor model for estimating the genetic covariance matrix (G-matrix) of high-dimensional traits, such as gene expression, in a mixed-effects model. The key idea of our model is that we need consider only G-matrices that are biologically plausible. An organism's entire phenotype is the result of processes that are modular and have limited complexity. This implies that the G-matrix will be highly structured. In particular, we assume that a limited number of intermediate traits (or factors, e.g., variations in development or physiology) control the variation in the high-dimensional phenotype, and that each of these intermediate traits is sparse - affecting only a few observed traits. The advantages of this approach are twofold. First, sparse factors are interpretable and provide biological insight into mechanisms underlying the genetic architecture. Second, enforcing sparsity helps prevent sampling errors from swamping out the true signal in high-dimensional data. We demonstrate the advantages of our model on simulated data and in an analysis of a published Drosophila melanogaster gene expression data set.},

abstract = {We introduce new statistical methods for analyzing genomic datasets that measure many effects in many conditions (e.g. gene expression changes under many treatments). These new methods improve on existing methods by allowing for arbitrary correlations in effects among conditions. This flexible approach increases power, improves effect-size estimates, and facilitates more quantitative assessments of effect-size heterogeneity than simple "shared/condition-specific" assessments. We illustrate these features through a detailed analysis of locally-acting ("cis") eQTLs in 44 human tissues. Our analysis identifies more eQTLs than existing approaches, consistent with improved power. More importantly, although eQTLs are often shared broadly among tissues, our more quantitative approach highlights that effect sizes can vary considerably among tissues: some shared eQTLs show stronger effects in a subset of biologically-related tissues (e.g. brain-related tissues), or in only a single tissue (e.g. testis). Our methods are widely applicable, computationally tractable for many conditions, and available at https://github.com/stephenslab/mashr.},

The current availability of hundreds of GWASs provides a unique opportunity to address these questions. We systematically analyzed 4,155 publicly available GWASs. For a subset of well-powered GWASs on 558 traits, we provide an extensive overview of pleiotropy and genetic architecture. We show that trait-associated loci cover more than half of the genome, and 90% of these overlap with loci from multiple traits. We find that potential causal variants are enriched in coding and flanking regions, as well as in regulatory elements, and show variation in polygenicity and discoverability of traits. Our results provide insights into how genetic variation contributes to trait variation. All GWAS results can be queried and visualized at the GWAS ATLAS resource (https://atlas.ctglab.nl).},
